# Map Action Mobile App

üöÄ **Map Action Mobile** 
 is an application used by citizens to report incidents. Users can capture a photo of the incident and, if they wish, provide a title, description, a 5-second video, and an audio recording. Geolocation is enabled in real-time.

Upon reporting, our AI-powered prediction model is immediately activated to detect the type of incident, its potential impact, context, and possible solutions for resolution.

Citizens can track the progress of their reported incidents through the mobile app

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This app leverages a modern tech stack for performance and efficiency:

- **React Native** for mobile app development.
- **Expo** for managing native features easily.
- **Django REST Framework** for backend APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database.

## üåç How It Works

1. **Incident Capture:** Take a photo of the incident directly from the app.
2. **Add Content:** Add a voice note to describe the situation and attach an explanatory video.
3. **Automatic Geolocation:** Incidents are geolocated automatically for precise documentation.
4. **Collaboration:** Multiple users or organizations can collaborate on the same incident.
